Git Basics Assignment



What I Learned:

How to create a Git repository, work with multiple commits creating branches and switch between them. Delete local branches, to add screenshots inside the repo.



Feedback:

Was lengthy and tough as I had not attended CP workshop so a bit difficult for me but got it lately.
